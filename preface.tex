I would like to thank everyone that makes UW-Madison an excellent place to learn and grow, in particular, to the many Professors I have had the privilege to work with.  A major thanks to Jeffrey Linderoth for advising me along the way, slowly converting me to the glory of linux workflows, and teaching me the tricks of the trade.  Also, a major thanks to Jim Luedtke for help with major parts of this work.  I would also like to thank the rest of the committee Bernard Lesieutre, Thomas Rutherford, and Stephen Wright for their advice and direction from their unique perspectives.  I would also like to thank Stephen Robinson for introducing me to Operations Research and showing me the usefulness and power of the field.

Thanks to my Mom, Dad, and Sister for always giving me a supportive environment to develop as a person and the much needed advice on all aspects of life. Thanks to Calan for giving me a bright future to look forward to and the motivation needed to finish this work.  Thanks to all my extended family and friends who make life so enjoyable.
