   IEEE test case with 118 buses, 180 branches,   Has generator and load data \newline \\
   Branch limits designed to ensure system reliablity for all N-1 cases \\
   Scenario tree has 3 outcomes for each node, and 4 stages \\
   Initial outage of 7 lines,   Objective weighting is greedy (10, 5, 1, .5) \\
   Varying reserve margin allowed for system

  IEEE test case 300 buses, 411 branchs

Talk about different data sets we are using, the strengths and limititations, and comparison to real world operating data
