\chapter{Literature Review and Background Material}

The literature review will begin with a review of current work on cascading power failures and then go into the optimization tools needed to solve these problems.  Throughout the literature review, we will develop the consistent notation and technology in order to fully frame the problem and work towards improving the system.

An ideal model is complex enough to capture the important features and effects of the process, while remaining simple enough to work with and remain believable.  Arbitrarly complex models can be made to produce the output matching nearly any process, but often there is no reason to believe that the individual mechanisms being modeled are important or represent a real part of the process.
