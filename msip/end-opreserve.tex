\textbf{Operating Reserves}

In this case an operating configuration need not be given.  The program can either search for an operating configuration as well as reserves or given an operating configuration, allocate the reserves.  These operating reserves determine where the system is able to relieve congestion in a contingency.
\begin{align}
p_{in} + r_{in} &\le \overline{P}_i \\
p_{in} &\le p_{i\rho (n)} + r_{i\rho (n)} \\
\sum_i r_{in} &\le \beta \sum_i \hat{d}_i 
\end{align}
where $\beta$ is the level of operating reserves alotted for the system.
