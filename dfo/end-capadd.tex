\textbf{Double the Capacity}

To begin, we will look at what happens when you double capacity on each line.  (\ref{fig:grad})  Out of the 186 lines, 51 lines resulted in an improved system with respect to the cascading process, 47 were within the margin of error of the nominal system, and 88 reduced the system performance.

Let's look along a line in each group.  It varies alot.  Less than 40\% of lines lead to a reduction in expected load shed when their capacity was doubled.
