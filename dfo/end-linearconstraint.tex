\textbf{Explicit Linear Constraints}

These constraints can be dealt with in the framework of generating set search.  Here, one needs to concern themselves only with the nearby active constraints and a satisifactory set of polling directions would be a positive spanning set of the tangent cone of the nearby active constraints.

The compass search for standard bound constraints conforms to the constraints ideally and no modifications need to be made other than letting $f = \inf $ for $x$ out of bounds and not waste the time on the function evaluation.
