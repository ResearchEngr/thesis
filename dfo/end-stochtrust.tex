\textbf{Stochastic Trust Region}	(Chang and Wan) \cite{chang_2009}

\begin{equation}
\min_{x \in \mathbb{X}^p} g(x)
\end{equation}
with $g(x) = \Expect [ G(x,\omega) ]$, 
$G(x, \omega)$ is stochastic response
$\omega$ stochastic effect of system
$x$ is controllable parameter
\begin{equation}
G(x, \omega) = g(x) + \epsilon_x
\end{equation}
$g(x)$ uknown deterministic function
$\epsilon_x$ is random error induced by $\omega$, assume $\epsilon_x \sim F( \dot )$ where 
$F( \dot )$ is a general distribution, mean zero and variance $\sigma_x^2$

Assumptions
$G$ expectation bounded above
$g$ bounded below, twice differentiable, gradient and Hessian uniformly bounded
for a sufficiently small neighborhood, $G$ can be modeled as a quadratic with error $\epsilon_x$ 
--Taylor Teorem (Trench 2003)

Strong Law of Large Numbers
\begin{equation}
\overline{G}_N (x) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N G(x,\omega_i) }{N} \rightarrow g(x) \mbox{    w.p. 1}
\end{equation}
as $N \rightarrow \infty$ for every $x \in \mathbb{X}^p$

Uses 2 stage process
initially, just use first order points
as trust region shrinks, there is transition points
begin to sample more, construct second order model, and reduce trust region at successful iterates
