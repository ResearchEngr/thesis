\section*{Summary}

Using Mixed-Integer Programming, a model will be developed for operating energy storage devices on electricity markets.  In particular, the storage devices are plug-in electric or hybrid vehicles.  These vehicles will have additional constraints which represent the consumers need for travel.  The electricity markets will be the day-ahead market and real-time market.  The problem will be formulated as a two-stage stochastic program.  The first stage the user will schedule the storage devices dispatch.  Since the user has a small amount of storage relative to the market, this problem will be decomposed from the market operators problem.  The user will simply be a price taker in the market.  The second stage will be the operation of the vehicle throughout the day.  Here the real-time price of electricity will be realized, as well any probable event the user may wish to do.  The user will make the decision whether to use the car to travel or a substitute.
