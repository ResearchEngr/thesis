\textbf{Hard Line Limits}

There is a notion of maximum line limits in this model, however these line limits cannot be attained simultaneously as is true with the current model.  Using the no failure risk measure \ref{nofail} and bounding according to some risk tolerance $\epsilon$, we have
\[ \prod_{e \in \cE} (1-z_e) \geq 1 - \epsilon \]
\[ \sum_{e \in \cE} \ln \left( 1-z_e \right) \geq \ln \left(1-\epsilon \right) \]
where the second constraint is an equivalent formulation using logarithms.
Then we note that all the terms are non-positive, so that the constraint must hold term by term, which gives
\[ \ln \left( 1 - g_e(y_e)  \right) \geq \ln \left( 1- \epsilon \right) \]
\begin{equation*}
g_e(y_e) \leq \epsilon
\end{equation*}
where the second inequality comes from taking exponentials of both sides and reducing. The line will have critical risk $\epsilon$ when $g_e(y_e) = \epsilon$, so that the hard line limits
\begin{equation} \label{hardline}
U^{\epsilon} = g^{-1}\left(\epsilon\right)
\end{equation}
will be an upper bound on line flow.
