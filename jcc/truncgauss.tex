\textbf{Truncated Gaussians}

Truncated gaussian's mean and covariance are known to be
\[  \E{\Omega}{ \hry_e | L \leq \hry_e } = \mu^y_e + \frac{\phi( \alpha_L )}{ 1- \Phi(\alpha_L)} \sigma^y_e \]
\[ \bP{\Omega}{ L \leq \hry_e } = 1 - \Phi(\alpha_L) \]
where $\alpha_L = \frac{L - \mu^y_e}{\sigma^y_e}$, the PDF $\phi(\cdot)$ , and the CDF $\Phi(\cdot)$ are for the standard normal distribution.
